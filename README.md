## üìÅ Project Overview

This repository includes the following projects:

1. Guess Game
2. Simple Calculator
3. Tic Tac Toe Game
4. Todo List Management

Each project is contained in its own folder with the source code and a detailed README file with instructions on how to run it.

## üéÆ Task 1: Guess Game

### Description
The Guess Game is an interactive game where the player has to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range.

### Features
- Random number generation
- Input validation
- Feedback on guesses (too high, too low)

### Usage
Navigate to the `GuessGame` directory and compile the source code using a C++ compiler:
```sh
g++ guess_game.cpp -o guess_game
./guess_game
```

## ‚ûï Task 2: Simple Calculator

### Description
The Simple Calculator performs basic arithmetic operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

### Features
- Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division
- Input validation
- User-friendly interface

### Usage
Navigate to the `SimpleCalculator` directory and compile the source code using a C++ compiler:
```sh
g++ calculator.cpp -o calculator
./calculator
```

## ‚ùå Task 3: Tic Tac Toe Game

### Description
The Tic Tac Toe Game allows two players to enjoy the classic game of Tic Tac Toe.

### Features
- Two-player game
- Input validation
- Display of the game board

### Usage
Navigate to the `TicTacToe` directory and compile the source code using a C++ compiler:
```sh
g++ tic_tac_toe.cpp -o tic_tac_toe
./tic_tac_toe
```

## üìù Task 4: Todo List Management

### Description
The Todo List Management application assists users in managing their tasks by adding, removing, and displaying tasks.

### Features
- Add tasks
- Remove tasks
- Display tasks
- Save and load tasks from a file

### Usage
Navigate to the `TodoList` directory and compile the source code using a C++ compiler:
